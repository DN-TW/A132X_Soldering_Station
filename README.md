## ⚙️ Technical Deep Dive: Ceramic Heater Control

Ceramic heaters like the A1321/A1322 are complex as they contain both the **heating coil** and a **temperature sensor** for sensing temperature.
These two model of ceramic heating element feture with different temperature sonsor and heating resistor. Please refer to **Basic for ceramic heating element.md** for more details.
